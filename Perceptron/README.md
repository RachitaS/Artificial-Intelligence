# Artificial-Intelligence

Implementation details:

1) Run the code using ./run.sh

2) After running the code the number of iterations taken to converge and the graph will be shown.

3) Once the graph is closed, the option for seeing the output for alligned output is shown.

4) After the previous step (after closing graph is chosen y), option for displaying the output for non linearly separable dataset is shown.
